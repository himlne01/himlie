			<h2>A Percy Jackson Musical?!</h2>

			<p>Attention Leah and fellow fangirls and fanboys. There is going to be a Percy Jackson musical called <em>The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical</em> released in 2018 on Broadway and will reach Minneapolis by 2019! Just kidding, I don't actually know. You would know more than I would. In fact, Leah, you listen to the soundtrack more than I listen to K-Pop music these days.</p>
			<p>But I hope you are not going to ask me to buy the soundtrack for you for Christmas. I know it will be the $18.95 spent. If you ask, maybe. But I will definitely fork over for a fandom t-shirt! You must spread your nerdiness! But on a side note, hopefully this show will be better than the movies. Haha.</p>
